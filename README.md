# rorschach-modern

RorschachModern is an application that serves up a web-based Rorschach test in the form of a survey. The application utilizes C# with HotChocolate GraphQL v10 for its backend processing and a JavaScript front-end with React for rendering the survey. An instance of SQL Server on Azure was used as the data storage medium for the database schema while the application was live.
